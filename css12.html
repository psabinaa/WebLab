    <h1>Css</h1>
    CSS is a style sheet language that manages the layout and presentation of websites. It allows developers to style the elements<br>
     and make a website interactive. This article will help you become familiar with CSS, its properties, and its different types
    <h2>CSS types</h2>
    <p>There are three types of CSS, namely inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</p>
    <p>Cascading Style sheet types: inline, external and internal</p>
  <summary><b>1. Inline CSS</b><br>
    The inline CSS enables styling a particular HTML element .
    It does not use selectors; instead, we need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag that requires styling.<br>
     In general, inline CSS is not recommended since it requires every HTML tag to be styled separately. Thus, it becomes pretty challenging to maintain websites by using only the inline CSS.</summary>
<br>Example
<h1 style="color: orange;">Welcome </h1>
<p style="color: black;">Step up and work hard</p>
<b>2. Internal or Embedded CSS</b><br>
Unlike inline CSS, internal or embedded CSS is used to style a single HTML page. We need to add the style attribute in the <head> section of a specific HTML page that requires styling.<br>
     However, it is not ideal for styling multiple web pages as we need to add the style attribute on every web page.
     <br>Example
     <style>
        h1 {color: purple;}
       
        </style>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Step up and Work hard</p>

        <br>
 <b>3. External CSS</b> <br>
 <p>In external CSS, the CSS code is written externally in a file having the ‘.css’ extension. A CSS file needs to be linked to a specific web page that requires styling.<br>
     It is important to notice that the external CSS makes it possible to keep the HTML and CSS code of a web page separated from each other. External CSS is the most effective way to style the complete website.</p>


     <h1>Welcome</h1>
     <p>Step up and Work hard</p>
<style>
     h1 {
        color: black;
        }
        p {
        color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
        }
    </style>
</body>
